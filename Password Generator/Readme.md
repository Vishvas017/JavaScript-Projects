Random Password Generator
This project is a simple and stylish Random Password Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface displays a clean, modern design with a centered layout and a bold heading inviting the user to generate a secure password.

🔐 How It Works

When the user clicks the “Generate Password” button, the JavaScript function creates a strong 12-character password that includes:

✔️ Uppercase letters

✔️ Lowercase letters

✔️ Numbers

✔️ Symbols

The script ensures the password contains at least one of each type for stronger security. The generated password appears in the text box above the button.

The user can also click the copy icon next to the password field to instantly copy the password to their clipboard.
